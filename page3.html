<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Welcome to "Broke New Yorker," an innovative yet controversial resource for navigating New York City on a budget. Our website provides a comprehensive guide starting from some of the jumpable subway entrances across the city, allowing those in need to bypass fare costs in a pinch and much more. While we recognize that this approach might be ethically debatable, we aim to offer practical information to help New Yorkers who find themselves short on funds.</p>

<p class="second">Use it wisely, stay safe, and remember â€” this is a guide for those in need, not a call to action against public services.</p>
